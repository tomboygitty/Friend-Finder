# Project Name
Friend-Finder

## Description
A questionaire app built with Node.js and Express.js for matching potential friends. The user answers 10 questions ranked on a 1-5 scale and is matched with the person whose answers most closely matches theirs.

## Motivation
This project was created to learn about the basic functions of Express.js with respect to creating a server, routing requests, and saving user inputs as a JSON object. For the end user, it is a simple personality test meant to facilitate making new friends.

## Results
The project was overall successful for the scope intended.

## Individual Responsibilities.
This project was written entirely by Tom Elliott.

### Challenges
Understanding the logic behind a modal overlay and the Chosen jQuery plugin.

## Improvements
Integrate SQL database for better data persistence, i.e. not losing new data when the server ends. More robust matching algorithms. Better visual presentation.
